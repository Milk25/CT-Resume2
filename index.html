    <p>Welcome to my professional web resume.</p>
    <p>Here is a brief introduction about myself.</p>
    <p>This is Amilcar Cornier a self-taught developer who has dedicated his time to learn various languages like Python, C#, and JavaScript. And in turn to learn HTML5 and CSS3. My goals is doing coding exercises and tutorials on HTML5, CSS3, Python, C#, and JavaScript. 
        I've been to and in time learning to code from Coding Temple. Which teaches its students Python and JavaScript. Furthermore am enrolled as well at Programmers Coach which teaches C#.
        These two school has given us the knowledge and grasp into Object Oriented Programming and its overall
        fundamentals. The syntax learned at theses schools will make me better at coding. Perhaps I will intentionally be better off at coding exercises. LeetCode and CodeWars are coding platforms out there to better a person into learning the field. Data Structures and Algorithms needs to be learned as well. But I have all the time in the world. I been following tutorials and reading up on these tasks. My overall performance will get totally better at due time. For now the structures of these boot camps are being learnt. For sure I've gotten well better. My only problems is the performance of my ability to speak well during an interview. My first language is Spanish which I know thoroughly. I need to study and perform my own interviews on my own. I can take notes and apply them to the questions being asked by the interviewer. Most likely I'll due great in the interview when I take notes and apply them to the source.  
        
        <p>I have my Bachelors in Science in 
        Computers in no time. When it comes to technology I love all that it is to it. I would love to get a job or 
        position in this field. I have the knowledge and know how in computer software development. Love reading books in 
        development and attending Colorado Technical University Online. I started July 4 of 2017 at this school and going 
        to graduate in 2025. I also have the ability to learn quickly and giving one hundred percent.</p>
    </p>     
    <p>I've been working harder at my intended goal. Which is to get employment as a software developer. My intentions is to get good with Employment
        job search but it has been difficult. Coding temple has given us advice on how to do just that. Which teaches students the key to finding a position in the tech field. Can one day come when I get employment. The answer to that lies in me. For surely
        getting and applying for a tech job will make me, but I intend to find a role. Everyday I respond to Indeed to make sure I open
        doors. Persistent and motivation is the way.</p>
        <p>As a software developer I want to start out by saying how to be dedicated and responsible. Being dedicated is one of my main goals and responsibility. I want to also mention that I have the talent, drive, and priority in life. My main goal is to focus solely in the importance of a programming language or too. I have spent time learning the ins and outs of how to be a software developer or engineer. I have read before that there are three pillars of knowledge based up on priority and motivation. Which are focus, priority, and dedication. These three things will guide you throughout the course of your own life.</p>
        <p>I want to thank the schools and its staff. With out them I wouldn't be here right know. There dedication and hard work has paid off. I can stress the importance of hard work. Taking in and assuring their knowledge has paved the way for me. I want to conclude that I am optimistic and getting employment soon will make for a better tomorrow.</p>

    <h2 class="education">Education</h2>
    <p class="dark">My education has been fun all along the way. I thrive in doing and learning whats valuable. I learnt many things at Colorado Technical university Online. Perhaps my greatest achievement was to use Adobe Craft and build and deploy an animal and reference of Africa in its GUI. This project was lots of fun. From learning all the different aspect of computer hardware to understanding PaaS, SaaS, and the other environments went well. Computer Science to me is complex in nature but yet practical. I love all that its to it.</p>
